We’re excited to invite you to our Winter Carpentry @ UCSB Community meeting. We’ll discuss plans for our Spring 2025 workshop schedule, explore ways to integrate AI into data science workshops, and, if time permits, share strategies for supporting learners after workshops. Whether you’re a curious Learner, an experienced Instructor, or anywhere in between, we’d love to see you there!

Here’s a preview of the agenda:
- 🗳️ Discussion about workshops to be offered in Spring 2025.
- 🤖 Teaching LLM Assistants and AI tools in Carpentries Workshops.
- 💡 Strategies to assist learners after a workshop.
- 🌎 Updates from community members and from The Carpentries.

This will be a hybrid event, so join us in person to enjoy the treats and great company or virtually if that’s more convenient. Either way, your voice is important, and we’d love your input on what workshops to offer next! 

In the meeting, we'll discuss the opportunity to become a certified Carpentries Instructor—a great chance for professional development if you're passionate about teaching and sharing your data science knowledge!
