Seth Erickson from the DREAM Lab will present a demo of Coder Workspaces, an on-demand virtual machine environment for data science. We’ll also welcome new members who recently completed Carpentries Instructor Training and discuss ways to better recognize the contributions of our community volunteers.

Here’s a preview of the agenda:
- 💻 Coder Workspaces demo
- 🤝 Welcoming our new members
- 🏅 Strategies to better recognize volunteers' contributions
- 🌎 Updates from community members and from The Carpentries
- 👩🏻‍🏫 Upcoming Carpentries Instructor Training opportunities

This will be a hybrid event, so join us in person to enjoy the treats and great company or virtually if that’s more convenient. Either way, your voice is important, and we’d love your participation! 

At the end of the meeting, we'll discuss the opportunity to become a certified Carpentries Instructor—a great chance for professional development if you're passionate about teaching and sharing your data science knowledge!
