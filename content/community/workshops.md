title: UCSB Carpentries Workshop Practices
---

## UCSB Carpentries
The Library's *DREAM Lab* organizes workshops on
behalf of campus constituents. * We can teach and host a variety of the curriculum
from Software, Data, and Library Carpentries, and are able to secure lead
Instructors for any lesson in the Carpentries curricula.

## Local Workshop Policies
- Got 5 friends? We will talk to you about hosting a workshop tailored to your needs.
- We reserve the option to cancel workshops when the number of learners at the beginning of a session drops below 6.
- We may re-schedule or cancel a workshop with fewer than 12 registrations with 48 hours notice
- No stickies, no robots

## Preparing for Workshops

* Review the Pre-Workshop Survey results paying special interest to question 14:
**Please Share what you most hope to learn from attending this workshop** This
will help instructors tailor the workshop to the needs of the attendees.

## Setting up workshops
* When spawning a UCSB Carpentry Workshop repo, copy email templates over as .md
files and customize for the event. * EventBrite: make 30 tickets available, and
waiting list of 10. * Don't forget to include data downloads on the setup
instructions.
