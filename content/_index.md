title: UCSB Library Carpentry Workshops
---

If you want to stay in the loop for future workshops, you can join our [Carpentry mailing list](https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/library.ucsb.edu/g/carpentry/about) with an @ucsb.edu email address and/or join our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/ucsbcarpentry/shared_invite/zt-3chxqtb2b-cVc3l~yj1ghUhZLNmOLfhQ).
If you do not have an @ucsb.edu email address, please [email the DREAM Lab](mailto:dreamlab@library.ucsb.edu) directly so we can add you.

**[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)** project is an international organization of volunteers teaching foundational coding and data science skills to researchers (Check out this [map of workshops held worldwide](https://feeds.carpentries.org/plot_workshops_map.svg)).
Carpentry Workshops at UCSB are supported and organized by our stellar volunteers and the DREAM Lab (formerly, Interdisciplinary Research Collaboratory) at UCSB Library.

We offer guided and hands-on workshops to researchers, including undergraduate, staff, graduate students, post-docs, and faculty.
These teachings focus on beginner-level research computing, data literacy, and information management.
Resources that persist outside of workshops are our community of data research and programming "carpenters" and the teaching materials of [previous workshops](https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/past-workshops).

For a few of us, teaching Carpentry workshops is part of our job descriptions, but most are volunteers from around campus and the global Carpentries community- including researchers, post-docs, graduate students, faculty and staff.
If you would like to get involved with putting on these workshops, please email us at **dreamlab@library.ucsb.edu** or visit our **[Carpentry Community Page](https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/community/instructors)**.
