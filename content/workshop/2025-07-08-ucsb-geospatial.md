description: "These hybrid (in-person and on zoom) sessions will be an un-workshop. We will work through the canonical lesson that introduces the essentials of working with raster and vector geospatial data in R. We will hightlight the learning objectives of the lesson: visualization, reprojections, and raster analisis. We will work with rasters—including multi-band and time series data—as well as work with vector features like points, lines, and polygons. Unique to this workshop, we’ll also collaboratively revise the Carpentries lesson as we go, making it more engaging and learner-friendly. Consider it a semi-workshop, semi-geospatial study group. Whether you're new to geospatial analysis or looking to sharpen your skills, join us for a hands-on, community-driven learning experience this July."
