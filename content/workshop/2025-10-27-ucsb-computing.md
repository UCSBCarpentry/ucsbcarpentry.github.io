description: "We're hosting two identical seminars, on October 27 and November 6. Register for the one that best suits your schedule.
<br> 
Join us for this 1-hour introductory seminar on High Performance Computing (HPC) resources at UCSB. The seminar is designed for researchers tackling projects that exceed their laptop's capabilities. This session will provide an overview of resources available to UCSB researchers (students, postdocs, researchers and faculty), and cover common use cases and workflows, showing how these transfer to the evolving HPC environments available both on and off campus. The seminar aims to optimize your workflow, so you can close your laptop and still get work done. Lunch will be provided!
<br><br>
This seminar is a collaboration among the Center for Scientific Computing (CSC), General Research IT (GRIT), Information Technology Services (ITS), the Library, and Letters & Science IT (LSIT)."
