description: "The Unix Shell is a powerful command-line interface that allows you to control your computer more efficiently than a traditional graphical interface. This hands-on workshop will introduce fundamental skills, including navigating files and directories, manipulating data, and writing simple scripts.
<br><br>
No prior experience is required to attend, just curiosity and a desire to work more efficiently with your computer. Learning these basics will open the door to advanced computing, including high-performance computing and version control with Git.
