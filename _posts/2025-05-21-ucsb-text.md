description: "If you’ve never worked with text data before and want to get started, this workshop is for you! You'll learn how computers can understand and analyze language, how to prepare text for analysis, and how to compare and explore documents based on their content. By the end of the workshop, you’ll have a better understanding of what goes into a text analysis project and how to take your first steps with your own data.
<br><br>
We’ll use Python in the workshop, but we’ll also point out how you can accomplish similar tasks in R, so you can choose the tool that works best for you."
