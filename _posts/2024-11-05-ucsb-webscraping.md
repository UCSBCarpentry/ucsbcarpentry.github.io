description: "Learn how to extract data from websites in this two-day workshop on web scraping with Python. We’ll begin by reviewing the structure of websites in HTML and how to retrieve information using your browser, the Requests library, and Beautiful Soup. You’ll also learn about the differences between static and dynamic web pages, and how to scrape the latter with the Selenium library. <b>This workshop is designed for participants who already have a basic understanding of Python programming.</b>"
