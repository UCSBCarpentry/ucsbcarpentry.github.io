description: "This two-day workshop introduces git, a command line tool for managing revisions in coding projects, and GitHub, a web-based platform for sharing your work and collaborating with others. The workshop is oriented toward learners with little or no previous experience with either git or GitHub. It will cover steps for setting up a git project, making changes, navigating the revision history, sharing work on GitHub, and using GitHub pages to publish a website."
