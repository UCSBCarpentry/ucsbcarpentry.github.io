description: Do you enjoy working on data science but not installing the software environment? Do you have nightmares about software library dependencies? Is your laptop slowing you down and want to use a more powerful remote server or cloud platform? In this workshop, we will show a reproducible and user-friendly approach to creating research environments using development containers. You will learn how to use Visual Studio Code to create containerized R and/or Python environments, customize them with extensions, Jupyterlab, and RStudio, and deploy them on NSF supported cloud instances like Jetstream2... All at the click of a button!
