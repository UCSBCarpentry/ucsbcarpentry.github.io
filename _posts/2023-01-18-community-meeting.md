### Agenda

- Introductions
- Community Updates
- Discussion: 
    - Briefly: Upcoming teaching opportunities: 
    - Data Access APIs (Seth): What are desirable characteristics for APIs used to access data from repositories within programming environments like R and python? In most cases, APIs are tailored to particular types of data (e.g., US Census data, or Twitter data), however there are a few “general purpose” APIs for accessing datasets in repositories (dataverse-client-r, rdataone). Are general purpose APIs for downloading datasets from repositories useful? If so, why hasn’t there been more standardization in this area? For example: a reliable way to download files for a dataset based on its DOI, regardless of repository.
    - Additional topics welcome!
