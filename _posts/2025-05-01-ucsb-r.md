description: "This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no programming experience. It starts with information about the R programming language and the RStudio interface. It then moves to loading in data and exploring how to visualise it with ggplot2. The next episode takes learners through an exploration of data frames and some common data cleaning operations, before discussing vectors and factors. The final episode introduces the flow of data in R, and how to combine operations to select, filter, and mutate a data frame.
<br><br>
This lesson assumes no prior knowledge of R or RStudio and no programming experience."
