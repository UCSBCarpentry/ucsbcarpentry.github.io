Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. Some data that is
available on the web is presented in a format that makes it easier to collect
and use it, for example in the form of downloadable comma-separated values (CSV)
datasets that can then be imported in a spreadsheet or loaded into a data
analysis script. The first part of this lesson will use browser
extensions to introduce the concepts of web scraping. The second part will
introduce the use of specialized libraries to scrape websites by writing custom
scripts and will require some familiarity with the Python programming language.
