description: "This workshop introduces some of the common methods and terminologies used in machine learning research. We'll cover topics such as data preparation and resampling, model building, and model evaluation. It is a hands-on workshop where participants will code in Python using the Scikit-learn package. While no prior knowledge of machine learning or Scikit-learn is required, attendees should have a basic understanding of programming in Python to participate effectively."
