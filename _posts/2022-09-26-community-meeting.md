### Agenda

The agenda is here to focus discussion, not enforce it.

- Short introductions
- New ground rules for UCSB Carpentry Community Meetings:
    - a venue for open discussion on topics in computational research
    - They should be fun and informative
    - Feel free to propose a topic!
    - __No workshop planning!__
- Project organization: how do you organize your project files? Do you use an established directory structure convention (e.g., [cookiecutter](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#directory-structure))?  
- R & geographic projections.
- Python local environments.
- So you've done some ML... what/how do you save your work?
- Topics for next meeting (October)
