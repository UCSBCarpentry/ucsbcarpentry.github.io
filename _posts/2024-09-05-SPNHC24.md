description: "Join us at SPNHC/TDWG 2024 for “A Practical Exploration of Biotic Interaction Data Management and Information Retrieval through Terrestrial Parasite Tracker (TPT) and Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI).”

During this two-hour long, participatory workshop collection managers, researchers, or data providers will use GloBI for data management and information retrieval. Our group exploration into the data will cover the data origins and data integration process and data products.

This workshop is open to anyone interested in biotic or species interaction data even if you are presently not using GloBI. We will highlight data from the Terrestrial Parasite Tracker project, but the methods are available for anyone interested in biotic interactions (see more at https://www.globalbioticinteractions.org/sources)."
