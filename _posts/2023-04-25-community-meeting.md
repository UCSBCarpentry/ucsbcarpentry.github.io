### Agenda

- Introductions
- Community Updates
- Discussion: 
    - We’ll take a deep-dive into Python, exploring “typing” and type hints. [Typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) is a relatively new and still maturing feature in Python. The basic idea is to use [annotations](https://peps.python.org/pep-0526/) with your functions and variables to specify their types. Type annotations can help you avoid common bugs and they make your code more expressive. Tools like [pydanitc](https://pydantic.dev/) (for data validation) and [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (for API development) rely heavily on type annotations.

*Additional topics welcome!
