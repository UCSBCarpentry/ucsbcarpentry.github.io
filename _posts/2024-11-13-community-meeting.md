We’re excited to invite you to our autumn **Carpentry @ UCSB Community meeting**, where we’ll gather in person (with coffee and donuts!) and over Zoom to connect, share, and plan our future workshops. Whether you're a curious Learner, an experienced Instructor, or anywhere in between, we’d love to see you there! Let us know if you are coming by [registering on Shoreline](https://cglink.me/2dD/r2263441).

Here’s a sneak peek at what’s on the **agenda**:

- 🗳️ Vote on the workshops you want to see in the Winter quarter and beyond!

- 🌎 Updates from community members and from The Carpentries.

- 👩🏻‍🏫 Upcoming Carpentries Instructor Training opportunities.

- ☕🍩 A casual space to enjoy coffee, donuts, and chat with fellow community members.

This will be a **hybrid** event, so join us in person to enjoy the treats and great company or virtually if that’s more convenient. Either way, your voice is important, and we’d love your input on what workshops to offer next! 

In the meeting, we'll discuss the opportunity to become a certified Carpentries Instructor—a great chance for professional development if you're passionate about teaching and sharing your data science knowledge! Interested? Join us at the meeting or email [dreamlab@library.ucsb.edu](mailto:dreamlab@library.ucsb.edu).
