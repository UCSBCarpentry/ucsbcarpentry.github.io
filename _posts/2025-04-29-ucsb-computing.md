description: "Join us for this 1.5-hour seminar on using Research Computing resources at UCSB. Weâ€™ll present several case studies for putting High Performance Computing (HPC) resources to use, including moving from GUI interfaces run locally (e.g. R, jupyter, etc.) to workflows for using HPC machines with web interfaces, the command line, or queue based methods.
<br><br>
The seminar is designed for researchers tackling complex projects that exceed their laptop's capabilities. We will have about 50 minutes covering the examples, followed by pizza, and 30 minutes of Q&A and/or further specific demonstrations.
<br><br>
Lunch will be provided."
