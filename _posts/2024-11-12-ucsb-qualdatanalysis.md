description: "Qualitative data allow researchers to delve deeply into human behavior, perceptions, and attitudes, offering a comprehensive perspective beyond what quantitative data can provide. This two-day workshop will guide attendees on how to ethically and effectively manage qualitative data from studies involving human subjects throughout its entire life cycle, from planning to sharing for future reuse. Participants will engage with de-identification and coding techniques using the free and open-source Qualcoder tool and will learn important data documentation and sharing recommendations to enhance transparency and trustworthiness in qualitative research."
