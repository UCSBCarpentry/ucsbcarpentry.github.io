description: "In this beginner-friendly workshop, you'll learn the basics of Git, a powerful command line tool for tracking changes in coding projects, and GitHub, a web-based platform for sharing and collaborating on code. We'll guide you through setting up a Git project, making and tracking changes, exploring revision history, and sharing your work on GitHub.
<br><br>
This workshop is designed for those with little or no prior experience with Git or GitHub. While no Git knowledge is required, some familiarity with the command line is recommended."
