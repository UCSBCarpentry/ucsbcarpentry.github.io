## UCSB Carpentries
* The Library's Interdisciplinary Research Collaboratory organizes workshops on 
behalf of campus constituents. * We can teach and host a variety of the curriculum 
from Software, Data, and Library Carpentries, and are able to secure lead 
Instructors for any lesson in the Carpentries curicula.

## Preparing for Workshops

* Review the Pre-Workshop Survey results paying special interest to question 14: 
**Please Share what you most hope to learn from attending this workshop** This 
will help instructors tailor the workshop to the needs of the attendees.

## Setting up workshops
* When spawning a UCSB Carpentry Workshop repo, copy email templates over as .md 
files and customize for the event. * EventBrite: make 30 tickets available, and 
waiting list of 10. * Don't forget to include data downloads on the setup 
instructions.
