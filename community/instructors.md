# Becoming a certified Carpentry Instructor

The [UCSB Library](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/) and [Enterprise Technology 
Services](https://www.it.ucsb.edu/) maintain a membership to the 
[Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).  Each year we send a cohort of 
people through the Instructor certification process, which includes:

* A 2-day, 16 hour training workshop plus some preparatory reading.
* Making an edit to a Carpentry lesson.
* Attending at least one session of a Carpentries discussion group.
* A practical teaching demonstration.

Once you are a certified Instructor, you are able to self-organize Carpentry 
Workshops on your own. The Library's Interdisciplinary Research Collaboratory 
also organizes and hosts about three workshops every quarter. If you participate in an upcoming instructor 
training, we expect some things from you in return: 
* Complete the certification process (there are 3 post-training tasks)
* Contribute to lessons on the UCSB Carpentry Repo 
* Be a helper and an instructor for a Library-organized workshop before the end of the next 
  school year 
* Participate in team meetings in the lead up to, and immediately after, workshops in which you participate. 

Beyond being an instruction, you can also conribute to Carpentries by being a workshop 
host/organizer or a lesson developer/maintainer. 
Team meetings for are Wednesdays from 9:00 - 10:20, and as needed to prepare for workshops.
