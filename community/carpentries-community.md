# Getting involved
If you've enjoyed one of our workshops, or have heard from a friend about the good work we do, we encourage you to engage with our community.

You can get involved  by teaching or helping in the workshops the Library's *DREAM Lab* hosts. Or maybe you're interested in having one of these workshops for your department or research lab, in which case you could be the host. Read below for more information on workshop roles, and the opportunity to become a Certified Carpentries Instructor.


## Workshop roles

Running a workshop is done through the group effort of people in organizing, teaching or assisting roles. The process is initiated by the <b>host</b>, when they decide to have a workshop in their department. To help with all the logistics involved, like advertising the workshop or recruiting instructors and helpers, the host could rely on a <b>coordinator</b>. On the  teaching side, a <b>lead instructor</b> guides decisions on curriculum and makes sure that instructors, helpers and workshop materials are ready.

Lead instructors are not expected to teach a whole workshop themselves: through <b>co-instructing</b>, others may teach segments of the lesson and support any discussion initiated by the lead instructor. Because workshops depend on live-coding and hands-on demos, <b>helpers</b> are needed to provide immediate help to attendees or to take notes in a collaborative document for those who fall behind.

Got 5 friends? The *DREAM Lab* staff will talk to you about hosting a workshop tailored to your group needs. [Email us](mailto:dreamlab@library.ucsb.edu) and we will help you organize it from the variety of curricula available in the Software, Data, and Library Carpentries.

## Becoming a Certified Carpentries Instructor

The <b>[UCSB Library](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/)</b> and <b>[the Office of the CIO](https://cio.ucsb.edu/about/cio)</b> maintain a membership to
<b>[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)</b>. Each year we send a cohort of
people through the Instructor certification process, which includes:

* A 16 hour training workshop that covers the basics of educational psychology, evidence-based classroom practices, and how to apply both to teaching workshops for The Carpentries.
* Attending a welcome session of The Carpentries.
* A practical teaching demonstration.
* Getting involved in the global community, by serving as an instructor or helper in a workshop, attending a community call, or making a contribution to Carpentries materials.

The training is completely free. In return, we ask for your involvement in the Carpentry @ UCSB community by:
* Completing the certification process.
* Serving as instructor for at least one lesson in a UCSB workshop.
* Serving as a helper for at least one complete UCSB workshop or contributing to the development of workshop lesson materials on GitHub.
